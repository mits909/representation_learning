# "Wine" and "Abalone" dataset classification.
In this project we applied PCA and LDA onto the dataset and analysed the resulting new representations in terms of interpretibilty and classifier impact. Then we created new reduced dimensions datasets. Later we classified the data using various classifiers, such as KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers.
